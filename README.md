# mdm

The markdown management CLI. No telemetry · Fully open source.

## Install

**macOS / Linux**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sethcarney/mdm/main/install.sh | bash
```

**Windows** (PowerShell)

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sethcarney/mdm/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

Both installers place the binary in `~/.local/bin/mdm` and will warn if that directory isn't in your `PATH`.

To install to a different directory, set `INSTALL_DIR` before running:

```bash
INSTALL_DIR=/usr/local/bin curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sethcarney/mdm/main/install.sh | bash
```
