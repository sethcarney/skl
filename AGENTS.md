# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What This Project Is

**MDM** (Markdown Management) is a Go CLI tool for managing "skills" — reusable markdown-based prompt libraries for AI agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Cline, Copilot, and 40+ others). Skills are installed from GitHub repos, GitLab, URLs, or local paths and placed into each agent's skills directory.

## Git Conventions

### Commit messages

Use semantic (Conventional Commits) format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <short description>

[optional body]
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `ci`

Examples:
```
feat(skills): add --dry-run flag to mdm skills add
fix(audit): handle nil response from OSV API
chore: bump Go toolchain to 1.26.3
docs(agents): add pre-PR checklist guidance
```

### Branch naming

Use a `<type>/<short-description>` prefix matching the commit type:

```
feat/dry-run-flag
fix/osv-nil-panic
chore/go1.26.3-toolchain
docs/pre-pr-checklist
```

## Commands

All commands run from the repo root:

```bash
make build    # Compile to ./mdm
make test     # Run all tests
make install  # go install . (installs to $GOPATH/bin)
```

Run a single test:
```bash
go test ./tests/ -run TestVersion
go test ./internal/skill/ -run TestFindSkills
```

Run with the debugger via `.vscode/launch.json` (Delve is configured).

```

### Key data flow

`mdm skills add` → `installer.go` orchestrates:
1. `source/` parses the input URL/path into a `ParsedSource`
2. `git/` clones the repo (shallow) or `blob/` queries GitHub API
3. `skill/` discovers `SKILL.md` files and applies `--skill` filters
4. User is prompted for which agents to install to (or `--agent` flag)
5. Skill dirs are copied into each agent's skills directory
6. `lock/` records the installation in `skills-lock.json`

### Adding a new agent

Add an entry to `AllAgents` in `internal/agent/` with the agent's skills dir path(s) and an optional `DetectInstalled()` function.

### Adding a new command

Create a file in `commands/`, define a `cobra.Command`, and register it either on the root command in `root.go` (for top-level commands like `upgrade`) or on the `skills` subcommand in `skills.go` (for skill management commands like `add`, `list`, etc.).

## Pre-PR Checklist

Before opening a pull request, run the `/go-report-card` skill — it runs all four CI checks in order and reports results:

```
/go-report-card
```

This runs: `gofmt` (auto-fixes in place), `go test ./...`, `govulncheck`, and `gocyclo -over 16`. All four must pass before a PR is opened. CI will run the same checks and block merge on failure.

If you need to run the checks manually:

```bash
# 1. Tests
go test ./...

# 2. Vulnerability scan
go install golang.org/x/vuln/cmd/govulncheck@v1.1.4
govulncheck ./...

# 3. Formatting — must produce no output
gofmt -s -l .
# Auto-fix with: gofmt -s -w .

# 4. Cyclomatic complexity — no function may exceed 16
go install github.com/fzipp/gocyclo/cmd/gocyclo@v0.6.0
gocyclo -over 16 .
```

## Windows Executable Icon

The Windows binary embeds an icon and version metadata via a `.syso` file that the Go linker picks up automatically when `GOOS=windows`.

### How it works

1. **`assets/mdm.svg`** — the canonical icon source (block-M + downward arrow, black on white).
2. **`assets/mdm.ico`** — a committed multi-resolution ICO (16 / 32 / 48 / 64 / 128 / 256 px). Because it's committed, CI needs no external image tools.
3. **`assets/versioninfo.json`** — goversioninfo config: file description, product name, icon path.
4. **`resource_windows.syso`** — generated at build time by `make syso`; git-ignored. The `_windows` suffix is a Go build constraint so it's only linked into Windows targets.
5. **`tools/gen-icon/`** — pure-Go program that renders the SVG shapes at all six sizes (4× supersampled for anti-aliasing) and writes `assets/mdm.ico`. No external tools required.

### Updating the icon

Edit `assets/mdm.svg`, regenerate the ICO, then commit it:

```bash
make icon   # runs go run ./tools/gen-icon/ → writes assets/mdm.ico
```

### Building the Windows exe locally (any platform)

```bash
make syso                                              # writes resource_windows.syso
GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build -o mdm.exe .       # links syso into the exe
```

On Windows (no GOOS override needed): `make syso && go build -o mdm.exe .`

Right-click `mdm.exe` → Properties → Details to verify the icon and version fields.

### goversioninfo is a declared tool dependency

`goversioninfo` is pinned in `go.mod` under the `tool` directive (Go 1.24+). `make syso` invokes it via `go tool goversioninfo` — no manual install required.

## Release Process

CI in `.github/workflows/release.yml` triggers on **tag pushes** matching `v*`. To release:

```bash
git tag v1.5.8
git push origin v1.5.8
```

GoReleaser builds binaries for Linux/macOS/Windows (x64 + ARM64), creates a GitHub release, and injects the tag as the version via ldflags. `internal/version/version.go` holds a `"dev"` fallback for `go install` users — do not bump it for releases, the tag is the source of truth.

Pre-releases work the same way: push a tag like `v1.6.0-rc.1` and GoReleaser marks the GitHub release as a prerelease automatically. `mdm upgrade` skips prereleases because GitHub's `/releases/latest` API excludes them.
